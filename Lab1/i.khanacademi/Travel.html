        <h1>Travel to .... Hawaii</h1>

        <h3>Reason to visiting the islands...</h3>
        <p>  With <em>over 750 miles of shoreline</em> and <em>over 400 named beaches</em>, all of which are public beaches, you're sure to find a beach in Hawaii that's perfect for you and your family. <strong>In Hawaii, you can also choose the color of your beach.</strong> There are white sand beaches, yellow sand beaches, black sand beaches, red sand beaches, and even one green sand beach. Since the ocean conditions can be unpredictable, my best advice, if you plan to go into the water, is to select a lifeguard protected beach.</p>
        <h2> List of places to be visited:</h2>
        <ol id = "list">
            <em><li class = "name">Oahu’s North Shore </li></em>
            <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/North_Shore_Hawaii_filmed_with_a_drone.webm/1200px--North_Shore_Hawaii_filmed_with_a_drone.webm.jpg" width = "250"><br>
            
            If you’re into surfing, then you might already know that the North Shore boasts some of the best winter waves in the world. Head to Banzai Pipeline to watch world-class surfers and even championship contests. The vibe is very laid back, and it is a great contrast to the busier parts of the island.<br>
            <em><li class = "name">Hapuna Beach </li></em>
            <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Hapuna-beach-aerial.jpg/1200px-Hapuna-beach-aerial.jpg" width="250"><br>
            Hapuna Beach boasts a long stretch of fine, white sand, and it is easy to find a spot away from other beachgoers. Hapuna is a top choice for families, and you can make the most of a beach day by bodyboarding or swimming. Towards one side of the beach, there are some reefs where you can even try snorkeling.
            <em><li class="name">Na Pali Coast </li></em>
            <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Hanakapiai_Beach%2C_Na_Pali_Coast%2C_Kauai%2C_Hawaii.jpg/1200px-Hanakapiai_Beach%2C_Na_Pali_Coast%2C_Kauai%2C_Hawaii.jpg" width = "250"><br>
            On the island of Kauai, also known as the Garden Isle, you can explore the famed Na Pali Coast. Along the coast, sheer cliffs covered in lush, green vegetation drop off rapidly, meeting the sands of private, secluded beaches. The scenery is unlike anything else on the planet.
