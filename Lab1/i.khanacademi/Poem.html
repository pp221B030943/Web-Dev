    <h1>You Will Hear Thunder</h1>
    <p> 
    You will hear thunder and remember me,<br>
And think: she wanted storms.The rim<br>
Of the sky will be the colour of hard crimson,<br>
And your heart, as it was then, will be on fire.<br>
<br>
That day in Moscow, it will all come true,<br>
when, for the last time, I take my leave,<br>
And hasten to the heights that I have longed for,<br>
Leaving my shadow still to be with you.
